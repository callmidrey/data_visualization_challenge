# data_visualization_challenge
This is my data visualization challenge discussion sheet
This analysis consisted of 2 separate datasets, mouse_metadata and study_results which was combined to form one dataset named mouse_data_complete
The number of unique combinations of mouse ID and timrpoints were 1888 with 249 observations
The duplicate was identified as mice with ID number `g989`
Data cleaning was done by dropping duplicates and a new dataset named 'clean_mouse_df'was created

# Statistics Summary
The drug regimen tested was analyzed by computing the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error with respect to the tumor observation and  output was printed.
It was observe that "capomulin" and "Ramicane" seem to be more effective in treating tumor in the population with the least values with respect to the analysis made, with impressively lower SEM.
It was also observed that the least effective treatement drug was "ketapril" with the highest stats and highest SEM
